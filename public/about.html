<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I’m Andy, an aspiring web developer currently studying to build modern,
  responsive websites and applications. I’m passionate about learning how great
  design and clean code come together to create engaging online experiences. As
  I deepen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, I’m
  actively working on personal projects and coursework to strengthen my
  understanding of front-end and back-end development. My goal is to grow into a
  well-rounded developer who can tackle real-world challenges and contribute to
  meaningful projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy fishing, family and casual
  gaming, and I’m always curious about how technology shapes the way we connect
  and share ideas. I’m excited to keep learning and to collaborate with others
  in the web development community. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!
